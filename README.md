# K-Nearest-Neighbor
K-Nearest Neighbour is one of supervised learning other words called KNN.
The Nearest Neighbor method is classified as a lazy learner because this method delays the training processor does not do it at all until there is test data that the class label wants to know. When there is test data for which you want to know the class label, then the new NN method will run the algorithm.
